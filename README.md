# Motion Classification with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
## Master Thesis 2022

This repo contains some of the code used in the experiments. The models are built with PyTorch, with SVM classifiers from scikit-learn. The code is uncommented, messy and some files are used for multiple experiments by commenting and changing the code.

The gradients of the line integral loss is manually implemented in the double_pendulum files.
