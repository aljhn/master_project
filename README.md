This repo contains some of the code used in the experiments. The models are built with PyTorch, with SVM classifiers from scikit-learn. The code is uncommented, messy and some files are used for multiple experiments by commenting and changing the code.

The most interesting result was compressed down to a four page paper and [accepted](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6EvTvGpiXe0) at the NeurIPS workshop: [The Symbiosis of Deep Learning and Differential Equations (DLDE) - II](https://dlde-2022.github.io/). A better reimplementation of the results intented for the workshop paper can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/aljhn/line_integral_loss).
